# Azure Sentinel Lab

This project focuses on setting up a virutal machine with Microsoft Azure, oening the firewall to allow any sort of traffic in attempts to collect log information and aggregate the data through Microsoft Sentinel.&#x20;



The Logs produced within the Honey pot is processed through a Log Analytics workspace and Sentinel creates a visualization of the attacker's geograhpical data and maps it onto a world map.&#x20;
